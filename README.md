# Customer Conversion Prediction using Machine Learning (CI/CD pipelines)

This repository contains code and resources for predicting visitor-to-customer conversion in an online store using machine learning. The goal of this project is to help online store owners improve their revenue by accurately predicting which visitors are likely to make a purchase.

## Project Overview
The project involves building a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to classify website visitors into two groups - those who are likely to make a purchase and those who are not. The data used for the project includes various features such as visitor location, time spent on the website, and product categories viewed.

### Data Collection
The first step in this project is to collect data on website visitors. This data can be collected using various tools such as Google Analytics. Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed and cleaned before it can be used for machine learning.

### Feature Engineering
After the data is cleaned, we need to engineer features that can be used by the machine learning algorithms. This involves selecting relevant features from the data and transforming them into a format that can be used by the algorithms.
